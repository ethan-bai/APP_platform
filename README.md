We designed a low-cost glass pipette pulling device called affordable pipette puller (APP) using Tinkercad and manuscript will be submitted for review soon.
This is what it looks as a whole.

For 3D printable parts, we have attached stl files (from A through E) exported from Tinkercad as well as the gcode files sliced by Ultimaker Cura for printing using Creality Ender 3 v2.
